# torchaudio-contrib

Goal: To propose audio processing Pytorch codes with nice and easy-to-use APIs and functionality.

:open_hands: This should be seen as a community based proposal and the basis for a discussion we should have inside the pytorch audio user community. Everyone should be welcome to join and discuss.

Our motivation is:

  - API design: Clear, readible names for class/functions/arguments, sensible default values, and shapes.
      - Reference: [librosa](http://librosa.github.io/librosa/) (audio and MIR on Numpy), [kapre](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/kapre) (audio on Keras), [pytorch/audio](https://github.com/pytorch/audio) (audio on Pytorch)
  - Fast processing on GPU
  - Methodology: Both layer and functional
    - Layers (`nn.Module`) for reusability and easier use
    - and identical implementation with `Functionals`
- Simple installation
- Multi-channel support

## Contribution

This is an early draft for a possible replacement of pytorch/audio. At this stage, we encourage interested users to discuss specific proposals in the [issue section](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/torchaudio-contrib/issues).

## Current issues/future work
- Better module/sub-module hierarchy
- Complex number support
- More time-frequency representations
- Signal processing modules, e.g., vocoder
- Augmentation

# API suggestions

## Notes
  * Audio signals can be multi-channel
  * `STFT`: short-time Fourier transform, outputing a complex-numbered representation
  * `Spectrogram`: magnitudes of STFT
  * `Melspectrogram`: mel-filterbank applied to `spectrogram`

## Shapes
  * audio signals: `(batch, channel, time)`
      * E.g., `STFT` input shape
      * Based on `torch.stft` input shape
  * 2D representations: `(batch, channel, freq, time)`
      * E.g., `STFT` output shape
      * Channel-first, following torch convention.
      * Then, `(freq, time)`, following `torch.stft`


## Overview
### `STFT`/`stft`
  ```python
  class STFT(n_fft, hop_length=None, len_win=None, window=None, center=True, pad="reflect", normalized=False, onesided=True)
  def stft(x, n_fft, hop_length=None, len_win=None, window=None, center=True, pad="reflect", normalized=False, onesided=True)
  ```

### `Melspectrogram`/`melspectrogram`
```python
class Melspectrogram(n_mels, sr, f_max, f_min, *args, **kwargs)
def melspectrogram(x, n_mels, sr, f_max, f_min, *args, **kwargs)
```
These are wrappers for `STFT` to which `*args` and `**kwargs` are passed to.

### `AmplitudeToDb`/`amplitude_to_db`
```python
class AmplitudeToDb(ref=1.0, amin=1e-7)
def amplitude_to_db(x, ref=1.0, amin=1e-7)
```
Arguments names and the default value of `ref` follow librosa. The default value of `amin` however follows Keras's float32 Epsilon, which seems making sense.

### `DbToAmplitude`/`db_to_amplitude`
```python
class DbToAmplitude(ref=1.0)
def db_to_amplitude(x, ref=1.0)
```

### `MuLawEncoding`/`mu_law_encoding`
```python
class MuLawEncoding(n_quantize=256)
def mu_law_encoding(x, n_quantize=256)
```

### `MuLawDecoding`/`mu_law_decoding`
```python
class MuLawDecoding(n_quantize=256)
def mu_law_decoding(x_mu, n_quantize=256)
```

# Remove SoX Dependency

We propose to remove the SoX dependency because:

* Many audio ML tasks don’t require the functionality included in Sox (filtering, cutting, effects)
* Many issues in torchaudio are related to the installation with respect to Sox. While this could be simplified by a [conda build or a wheel](https://github.com/pytorch/builder/issues/279), it will continue being difficult to maintain the repo.
* SOX doesn’t support MP4 containers, which makes it unusable for multi-stream audio
* Loading speed is good with torchaudio but e.g. for __wav__, its not faster than other libraries (including cast to torch tensor) -- as in the graph below. See more detailed benchmarks [here](https://github.com/faroit/python_audio_loading_benchmark).

## Proposal

Introduce I/O backends and move the functions that depend on `_torch_sox` to a `backend_sox.py`, which is *not* required to install. Additionally, we could then introduce more backends like scipy.io or pysoundfile. Each backend then imports the (optional) lib within the backend file and each backend includes a minimum spec such as:

```python
import _torch_sox

def load(...)
    # returns audio, rate
def save(...)
    # write file
def info(...)
    # returns metadata without reading the full file  
```

### Backend proposals

* `scipy.io` or `soundfile` as default for __wav__ files
* `aubio` or `audioread` for __mp3__ and __mp4__


### Installation

`pip install -e .`


### Importing

import torchaudio_contrib
